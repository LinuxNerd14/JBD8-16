# The JBD8-16

![Current Design](Schematic.svg)
    A computer with the skeleton of the BE6502 by the revered [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/) with the ultimate goal of running DOOM and making a decent platform for programing in asembly or C at a very fundemental level.

    This computer is currently still deep in hardware development but has a diverse set of planned features like hardware based random numbers and way more RAM than what is reasonable along with an implimentation of the VERA by the [8BitGuy](https://www.the8bitguy.com/).

This is by far not a finished project as these features awaiting implimentation:

1. Memory bank
2. Proper random number generator
3. Micro SD card
4. Better display or VGA output
5. Easily reproducable PCB's
