# The JBD8-16
![Current Design](Schematic.svg)
A computer that was once based on the BE6502 by the revered [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/).
This new design has 8 banks of 32K SRAM totaling in 256K, 32 I/O addresses, and a hardware based random number generator.

This is by far not a finished project as planned features include:
1. PS2 keyboard port
2. Proper random number generator
3. 2 NES contoller ports
4. SD Card??  (Many compicated issues with this one)
5. Better display or VGA output


Thank you [Brian Dean](https://github.com/NonzeroCornet) for your contributions to the software.
