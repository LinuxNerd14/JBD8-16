# The JBD8-16
![Current Design](Schematic.svg)
A computer with the skeleton of the BE6502 by the revered [Ben Eater](https://eater.net/) with the ultimate goal of running DOOM and making a solid platform for programing in asembly or C.
This computer is currently still in deep in hardware development but has a diverse set of planned features like hardware based random numbers and way more RAM than what is reasonable.

This is by far not a finished project as planned features include:
1. PS2 keyboard port
2. Proper random number generator
3. 2 NES contoller ports
4. Micro SD card
5. Better display or VGA output


Thank you [Brian Dean](https://github.com/NonzeroCornet) for your contributions to the software.
